# History of The Nottingham New Theatre

## Dramsoc

The University College Nottingham Dramatic Society (Dramsoc) was formed in 1927 and performed its first play, A.A. Milne's 'Mr Pim passes by' in the following March. The society offered members an opportunity to read, discuss, produce and enact plays. The late 1950s and early 1960s were a golden age for the society. The production of 'Coriolanus' reached the finals of the National Student Drama Competition, and the 'Taming of the Shew' enjoyed a week-long tour of Germany. The society also took George Bernard Shaw's 'St Joan' to the outdoor Minack Theatre in Cornwall. DramSoc was eventually disbanded in the 1980s

At this time, TEC (the Technical Executive Committee of the Students' Union) was organised as a number of Departments, of which SPD (the Stage Productions Department) was responsible for theatre lighting and sound. The SPD Manager of TEC was ex officio Technical Director of Dramsoc, as well as taking responsibility for the electrics at the annual University Opera, performed in the Great Hall of Trent Building.

NTG (the Nottingham Theatre Group) was a separate body, which as far as I recall did not receive grant funding from the Students' Union, whose purpose was to present an annual revue at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. These shows were developed and previewed in New Theatre. NTG would typically rent a venue in Edinburgh and fit it out as a temporary theatre, sub-letting the space and equipment to other Fringe groups such as Durham Student Theatre or Bristol Revunions. The SPD Manager also served as the Technical Director of NTG.

## Nottingham Everyman Club

Nottingham's Everyman Club was formed in 1958, to encourage students and local people in the city, who were interested in theatre, to collaborate on productions. The club had some notable successes in the 1960s.

## The New Theatre

The Nottingham New Theatre is a playhouse and production company based on University Park campus, Nottingham, England. It is funded in part by the University of Nottingham Students' Union and constitutes one of the Union's Media Groups. It is the only entirely student-run theatre in England.

The New Theatre has existed in one form or another for about 70 years. The earliest member on our database graduated from the university in 1945, and we have had a solid stream of members for the last 70 years.

The New Theatre was originally housed in the Archaeology and Classics building of the University of Nottingham. In 1966, members of the Technical Committee (responsible for the stage lighting activities and equipment on behalf of the Students' Union), were involved with equipping the theatre. At this point, the New Theatre company had not been formed.

In 2001 an extended foyer was added to the building, following a donation from an alumnus of the Theatre.

In the summer of 2012, the Archaeology and Classics building was demolished which saw an extensive redevelopment of the building housing the New Theatre. This left the New Theatre as its own freestanding building. Parts of the old building were retained and repurposed as new rehearsal rooms/studio spaces, storage rooms and a new constume cupboard. The foyer was also significantly extended. Along with this, a fundraising campaign also allowed the technical parts of the theatre to be modernised significantly.

In 2012 the committee voted to alter the name of the theatre from "The New Theatre" to "The Nottingham New Theatre".
